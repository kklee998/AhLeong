Overview:
Nowadays young gen has grown hostile towards the traditional industry, especially banks. According to our market research, almost every single one of them say they're either overwhelmed by the complicated banking processes or simply don't trust the big corporates.

In order to bridge this technological and cultural gap, we need a new image for this up and coming market segment. Social media is already part of our everyday lives, and that's exactly where the banks should start from --- seamlessly integrating into something we're familiar and comfortable with.

For that, a messenger chatbot AhLeong is created to make online banking friendly and convenient at the same time.
